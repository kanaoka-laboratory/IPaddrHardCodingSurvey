## Applications with hard-coded IPv4 addresses

The smali files extracted from the APK files were subjected to string matching and exclusion of specific information using regular expressions. As a result, 184,354 applications were identified as containing IPv4 addresses. This is the number of applications that were identified as having at least one IPv4 address in one application.
Of the total number of applications surveyed, 37.40% were found to be hard-coded with IPv4 addresses.
In addition, a total of 24,980 different IP address occurrences were observed.
