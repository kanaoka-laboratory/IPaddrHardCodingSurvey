## AndroZoo
Androzoo is a service that collects android applications and provides them.
As of September 1, 2021, it is reported to hold 16,370,174 APK files.
In this study, we use the data from Androzoo to analyze the applications.

See [AndroZoo](/androzoo/) for details.

## Tools
In this study, we convert APK files of Android applications to Smali files and statically analyze the contents of the Smali files.
For the conversion to Smali files, we used [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/).

## Programs
The program used for the analysis in this study will be available (Sep 1, 2021).
